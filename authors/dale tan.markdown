I've been programming JavaScript heavily for the past three years now and didn't really know too much about programming prior to that.  I can definitely say it is my first programming language.  I learned my ways working no the Nike account @ [R/GA][rga] in NYC.  Though I moved to Burlington, VT to work for [Dealer.com][ddc], I'm still doing freelance work for [R/GA][rga].

I just started learning nodeJS in early June and am completely hooked on it.  I'd love to contribute to a CMS and chat client.
